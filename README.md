# monster
 A trouble in terrorist town spin off for minecraft bukkit servers where there is one traitor who gets stronger as the game progresses! Also inspired by other similar games such  as among us and town of salem.
 
 To start the game simply type /startgame <border radius>
 
 This game mode can be played on any minecraft map. On start, one random person is chosen to be the monster and is notified. For every kill they get, they gain health. They also get a buff upon getting a kill that increases their max hearts. Every minute the monster recieves a item which when right clicked while pointing at the air will locate the nearest
 player. They can also craft and use golden apples in a similar manner to raise their base attack damage.
 
 Every 5 minutes a town meeting is called with a 1 minute warning beforehand. When this happens, all players are teleported to a 40 by 40 block area in the center of the map. They then have two minutes to discuss who they think is the monster. After 2 minutes they are teleported back to whatever they were doing.
 
 To end the game, either the monster is killed, or the monster kills all of the players.
 
 Compile through your java ide by adding the version of craftbukkit you wish to use to the build path and then compiling to a .jar
 
 Insert this jar into the plugins folder of your server and simply launch the server to run the plugin!
